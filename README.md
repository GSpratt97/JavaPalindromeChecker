# JavaPalindromeChecker

Java program to check whether inputted word is a palindrome or not.

Functionality is hardcoded as aligned with the MVP.

The 'sentence' class is used to take a sentence String that may contain palindromes and returns the longest palindrome. This is achieved by first breaking the String sentence into an array of Strings, where each string can then be analysed using the code created initially to check for palindromes.
